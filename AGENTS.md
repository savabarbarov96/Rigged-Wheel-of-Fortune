# Repository Guidelines

 - Build output: `dist/` (generated by `npm run build`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install`: Install dependencies.
- `npm run dev`: Start Vite dev server on `http://localhost:3000` (auto-opens).
- `npm run build`: Production build to `dist/`.
- `npm run preview`: Serve the production build locally.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- **Vue 3 + Composition API** (inside `setup()`); components in PascalCase (`WheelComponent.vue`).
- **Composables**: prefix with `use` and place in `src/composables/` (e.g., `useRigging.js`).
- **Events/props**: emit names in kebab-case (e.g., `spin-complete`).
- **JavaScript**: ES modules, single quotes, no semicolons, 2-space indentation.
- **Styles**: prefer scoped styles in SFCs; shared rules in `src/style.css`.

## Testing Guidelines
- No test setup yet. Contributions adding tests are welcome.
- Recommended: Vitest + Vue Test Utils. Place specs alongside components or under `src/__tests__/` using `*.spec.js` (e.g., `src/components/__tests__/WheelComponent.spec.js`).
- Suggested script once added: `"test": "vitest"`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Current history is minimal; follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`) with concise, imperative subject.
- PRs: include a clear description, linked issues, steps to test, and screenshots/GIFs for UI changes. Keep PRs focused; update docs when changing behavior or config.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Admin PIN is defined in `src/components/PinModal.vue`; change it before deploying. Do not treat this client-side PIN as real auth.
- Avoid committing secrets. If using environment variables, expose only `VITE_*` keys for client use per Vite conventions.
- Validate wheel config with `useRigging.validateConfiguration()` when introducing new inputs.
